# Definition of Done, KriegerDataForge

Kept byte identical across every KDF repo by the kit sync engine. "CI is green" is necessary but **not**
sufficient. A change is *done* when it meets the bar below for **its change type**. The repo's
`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` is the checkbox form of this doc. Keep it in sync. Its Testing
section should reduce to a single **`make ci`** gate rather than a hand maintained list of granular
sub-commands (which drift from the Makefile), and **every command it names must be a real target in
that repo's Makefile** (`make help`).

**Scope note.** The conditional sections below apply **only to repos that have that surface**. A
static export site or a package repo has no migrations, generated API clients, or Vercel compactor.
Skip those sections rather than inventing the ceremony.

---

## Baseline, every change

- [ ] **Local `make ci` is green** (lint, type-check, tests, and the repo's security/audit steps).
- [ ] **Version bumped** with the repo's script. Level by impact (no behavior/contract → patch,
      additive feature/contract → minor, breaking change → major). Any required post-build sync run
      (e.g. `make vercel-compact`). The CI check enforces consistency + strictly-ahead, not the level.
- [ ] **Scoped.** The diff does only what the *approved plan* said, no unrelated drive by changes.
      Ambition belongs in the **plan** (proposed to the owner). Restraint belongs in the **diff**.
      Never smuggle a bigger idea silently into the code.
- [ ] **Self reviewed.** You read your own diff as a reviewer before opening the PR.
- [ ] **No secrets** in code, tests, commits, or logs.
- [ ] **PR describes** what changed and how it was verified, links the issue/epic if any.

## If it changes behavior or adds a feature

- [ ] **Tests added at the right tier** (of the tiers this repo actually has, `make help`). Unit
      for pure logic/validation/calculations, integration for endpoints/components/flows, end-to-end
      for a critical user path. New endpoints and server actions always get tests.
- [ ] **Edge cases + failure paths** covered, not just the happy path.
- [ ] **Docs updated.** The doc that describes this behavior (README/`docs/*`) reflects reality:
      organized, front-doored, and deprecated-not-deleted per
      [`DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md`](DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md).
- [ ] **E2E journey current.** If this repo owns one (`e2e/manifest.json` + spec, discovered per repo by
      the CICD `run-e2e` engine, dormant until the `RUN_E2E_GATE`/`RUN_E2E_CD` repo vars are set) and the
      change touches its covered flow, update the journey. See
      `kriegerdataforge-cicd/docs/guides/E2E_TESTING.md`.

## If it's architectural or introduces a new pattern

- [ ] **Went through the design gate**. Design doc + **ADR (`D-NNN`)** in
      `docs/CHANGELOG_AND_DECISION_LOG.md` (create it if absent), approved by the owner before building.
- [ ] **Decision log updated** with the outcome and any deviations from the design.

## If it changes data (schema / migration)

- [ ] **Backward compatible migration** (expand now, contract later). `main` stays deployable
      against both old and new at every step.
- [ ] **Rollback path** stated, how to revert safely if the deploy goes bad.
- [ ] **Migration runs cleanly** forward (and the down path is sane).
- [ ] **Identity decoupling respected**, in the **hub** (`kriegerdataforge`), user FKs reference
      `kdfusers.id`. In a **tenant app DB** (fitness, tiffanys, …), `user_id` is a **plain column
      from the verified JWT, no cross-DB FK to `kdfusers`**, and no per-app user/identity table.

## If it's security relevant (auth, OIDC, tokens, sessions, authz, secrets, CSP, infra, CI)

- [ ] **Followed the matching [`skills.md`](../../skills.md) scenario.**
- [ ] **Server is authoritative**. Security/$-relevant values recomputed, never trusted from the client.
- [ ] **Incentive / gamification surfaces are abuse resistant** (if present). Points/badges granted
      server-side from verified events only. Award endpoints **idempotent** (keyed on the source event)
      against replay. Streak windows on the **server clock**. Grants append-only/auditable and
      rate-limited. Leaderboards computed from server-owned totals. See the gamification scenario in
      [`skills.md`](../../skills.md).
- [ ] **Least privilege.** Closed request schemas + field allow lists, exact ownership checks,
      validated `iss`/`aud` with distinct per-client audiences.
- [ ] **OIDC/auth-protocol change** carried a design note and stays backward compatible through the transition.
- [ ] **Adversarial review before handback**. A pass that tries to *refute* the change (missing
      authz, broken contract, violated rule). Use `/code-review ultra` or reviewer sub-agents if your
      tool supports them. Otherwise do the refutation pass manually. When the owner wants an independent reading by
      more than one model, of a function or of every repo, follow [`CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md`](CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md).

## If it touches a cross repo contract (API / OpenAPI / SDK)

- [ ] **Contract changed first, in the repo that owns it**, consumers regenerated after. A per app
      API through its backend's OpenAPI (`make openapi` → frontend `make generate-client`, a
      **read only** generated client). The SDK slice only when the **auth/JWT** contract changes.
- [ ] **Epic tracker** in `kriegerdataforge/docs/epics/<name>.md` updated, this PR links to it.
- [ ] Shipped **behind a feature flag**, the flag/rollout is documented.

## If it adds a user facing surface

- [ ] **Observability.** Meaningful logs/telemetry for the new path (no secrets/PII in logs).
- [ ] **Accessibility & responsive** basics for UI (keyboard, labels, mobile).
- [ ] **Errors are user friendly**, not raw/technical. Error details are sanitized.
