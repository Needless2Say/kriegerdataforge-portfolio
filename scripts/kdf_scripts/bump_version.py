"""
Bump the project version (patch | minor | major) across all version-bearing files.

Canonical ecosystem script (source: ``kriegerdataforge-cicd/scripts/common/``,
vendored byte-identical to every repo as ``scripts/bump_version.py`` by
``distribute_scripts.py`` — ADR D-013). Which files get written is decided by
``version_targets.py`` (auto-detect by presence, or the repo's optional
``scripts/version_targets.json`` manifest) so this script and the CI checker can
never disagree about the target set.

The bump is computed from **origin/<base-branch>'s VERSION** whenever it is
readable — NOT from the local VERSION file. That makes an accidental double-bump
impossible: re-running ``make bump-patch`` is idempotent (0.10.6 on main stays
-> 0.10.7), and ``make bump-minor`` after a stray patch-bump corrects the branch
to 0.11.0 instead of stacking on top. When origin/<base-branch> cannot be read
(fresh clone, offline, brand-new repo) it falls back to the local VERSION with a
warning — CI still enforces the strict single-increment rule either way.

A FastAPI app's committed ``openapi.json`` is generated from the app, so where the
app reads its version from VERSION the spec's ``info.version`` goes stale on every
bump. The bump moves that one value too, and only when the spec carries a version
being bumped from, so a spec whose app publishes a literal version is left alone.
Writing files is this script's job. The CI side (``check_version.py``) only reads
(ADR D-017).

Usage:
    python scripts/bump_version.py <patch|minor|major> [--base-branch main] [--root PATH]
