# The agentic workflow kit. What's in this directory and how to use it

Kept byte identical across every KDF repo by the kit sync engine (canonical source:
`kriegerdataforge-cicd/kit/common/`, version marker. [`KIT_VERSION`](KIT_VERSION)). This directory
plus the repo root [`WORKFLOW.md`](../../WORKFLOW.md) and [`skills.md`](../../skills.md) **is the
kit**, the shared operating standard that lets any developer or AI agent work the same way in
every KriegerDataForge repo. **Never edit the kit files locally** (a local edit is drift and gets
overwritten). Change `kit/common/` in `kriegerdataforge-cicd` instead. Repo specific agent
deep dives (`<slug>.md`) may live alongside these files and are repo-owned.

## Reading order (first time in the ecosystem)

1. **`AGENTS.md`** (repo root, per repo). What this repo is, its vision, module map, critical rules.
2. [**`WORKFLOW.md`**](../../WORKFLOW.md) (repo root, kit). The three lane loop every task follows:
   Quick / Standard (plan → owner approves → implement → `make ci` → PR) / Epic.
3. [**`skills.md`**](../../skills.md) (repo root, kit). The scenario organized security playbook.
   Read the matching scenario before any security sensitive work.
4. This directory. The deeper standards below, consulted when their topic comes up.

## What each file here is for

| File | What it is | Consult it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`AGENT_OPERATING_STANDARD.md`](AGENT_OPERATING_STANDARD.md) | The "why" behind the whole standard. The five principles, the three lanes with worked examples, who owns which contract, the glossary | You want to understand how the pieces fit, or you're prompting/reviewing an agent |
| [`DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`](DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md) | The real bar beyond "CI is green", scaled by change type | **Before opening any PR** |
| [`DESIGN_AND_EPICS.md`](DESIGN_AND_EPICS.md) | The design gate + cross repo Epic playbook (design doc → ADR → approval → vertical slices) | Anything complex, novel, or spanning repos |
| [`DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md`](DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md) | How repo docs are organized, kept honest, and kept discoverable (taxonomy, README front door, deprecate with banner) | Any documentation work |
| [`REPORTS_STANDARD.md`](REPORTS_STANDARD.md) | The reports standard. The six Projects boards + the AI bug reporter. Certified packages, adoption recipes, security posture, per repo type applicability | Touching reports/boards/triage, or adopting the feature in an app |
| [`CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md`](CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md) | The KDF Code Review Process. A repo reviewed one slice at a time by fresh Claude and Codex sessions and Sol rounds. The roles, the cycle, the rules, severity, the artifacts and the security model | Reviewing a whole repo or package for production readiness |
| [`templates/design-spec.template.md`](templates/design-spec.template.md) | Copy me 10-section design spec → `docs/design/{feature}.md` | The design gate applies |
| [`templates/adr-entry.template.md`](templates/adr-entry.template.md) | Copy me ADR block → `docs/CHANGELOG_AND_DECISION_LOG.md` | Recording an architectural decision (`D-NNN`) |
| [`templates/epic-tracker.template.md`](templates/epic-tracker.template.md) | Copy me tracker → `kriegerdataforge/docs/epics/{name}.md` (the hub) | Coordinating a cross repo Epic |
| [`templates/contributor-onboarding.template.md`](templates/contributor-onboarding.template.md) | Copy me onboarding spine → `docs/guides/CONTRIBUTOR_ONBOARDING.md` | Creating/refreshing a repo's contributor onboarding |
| [`templates/review-plan.template.md`](templates/review-plan.template.md) | Copy me review campaign plan → `docs/security/<PFX>_REVIEW_PLAN.md` | Starting a review campaign |
| [`templates/review-brief.template.md`](templates/review-brief.template.md) | Copy me reviewer brief, one for Claude and Codex → `docs/security/<PFX>_REVIEW_<slice>_PROMPT.md` | Step 2 of a slice, and the final review |
| [`templates/review-report.template.md`](templates/review-report.template.md) | Copy me report format for a fresh reviewer | A reviewer writing its report |
| [`templates/review-adjudication.template.md`](templates/review-adjudication.template.md) | Copy me adjudication log → `docs/security/<PFX>_REVIEW_<slice>_ADJUDICATION.md` | Step 0 of a slice |
| [`KIT_VERSION`](KIT_VERSION) | The kit version this repo carries | Checking sync state / reporting drift |

## How to use the kit to work well here

- **Every task**. Pick a lane in `WORKFLOW.md` and follow its loop. Plan first, owner approves,
  `make ci` green locally before any PR, never self-merge.
- **Before a PR**. Walk `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` for your change type. The PR template is its
  checkbox form.
- **Security sensitive work** (auth, tokens, secrets, CSP, payments, infra, CI). Open `skills.md`
  first and follow the matching scenario. When unsure, choose the fail closed option.
- **Docs work**. Follow `DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md`. Code is ground truth. Update the doc in the
  same PR as the behavior. Deprecate with a banner, don't delete.
- **Reviewing a whole repo or package**. Follow `CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md`. The plan comes from the template, the owner
  approves it, and each slice runs the cycle before its pull request opens.
- **To improve the kit itself**. Propose the change in `kriegerdataforge-cicd` (`kit/common/` +
  both `KIT_VERSION` markers), per *How the standard is maintained* in
  [`AGENT_OPERATING_STANDARD.md`](AGENT_OPERATING_STANDARD.md).
