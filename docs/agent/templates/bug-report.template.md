# {YYYY-MM-DD} {The bug, in one line}

> **How to use.** Copy this to `REPORT.md` in `docs/bugs/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}/` the day a bug is taken up that is more
> than a Quick fix, with `LOG.md` beside it from [`work-log.template.md`](work-log.template.md), fill every `{...}`, and
> delete this box and every hint in braces. A Quick fix needs neither, its pull request is its record. Name a secret's
> variable, never its value, cite a user's report by its id, never its text, and leave out anything sensitive, which
> never goes into any repo. A public repo's bug report and its log are kept in the ecosystem's private context for
> good, never in the public repo. Read the staged diff before each commit, and every outgoing commit's patch before a
> push.
