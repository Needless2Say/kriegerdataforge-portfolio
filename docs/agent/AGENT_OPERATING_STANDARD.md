# The KriegerDataForge AI Agent Operating Standard

> The kit sync engine keeps this doc **byte identical** across every KriegerDataForge (KDF) repo. This is the human readable
> *why* and *how it all fits* behind the operational files. Read it once to understand the standard.
> Use [`../../WORKFLOW.md`](../../WORKFLOW.md) day to day. If anything here and an operational file
> ever disagree, the operational file wins and this doc is the bug. Fix it in the canonical source
> (`kriegerdataforge-cicd/kit/common/`).

## Who this is for

- **The owner**, prompting an AI model to build something, small or ecosystem-spanning.
- **Other developers**, reviewing agent authored PRs and needing to know the bar they're held to.
- **The agents themselves** (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, GPT, any tool), as the orientation
  layer above the step by step workflow.

## The standard in one breath

One canonical guide per repo (`AGENTS.md`), one shared workflow (`WORKFLOW.md`), **three lanes
chosen by scale**, *design before code* for anything big or novel, large work shipped as **many
small feature flagged PRs** (never one mega PR), every touched repo's **vision honored**, and **the
owner merges**, always.

---

## The five principles

1. **Match ceremony to scale.** A typo is not a system. A system is not a typo. The lane you pick
   should fit the work, and when unsure, *size up one lane, not down* (under sizing is the most
   expensive mistake).
2. **Vision first. Every repo you touch.** Before designing, read the **Vision & purpose** and
   **Critical rules** in the `AGENTS.md` of *every* repo in the blast radius, not just the one you
   started in. A change that's locally sensible can still violate another product's vision. If two
   repos' visions conflict, surface it to the owner, never resolve it silently.
3. **Aim high, then ship it safely.** Reach for the *best* solution the vision deserves, not the
   smallest patch that closes the ticket. Be **unrestricted in what you propose**. Be **disciplined
   in how you land it**. The gates constrain *how you ship*, never *how big you think*. A better
   idea than the task asked for goes in the **plan as a proposal**, never silently into the diff.
4. **Design before code. Big work is many small flag gated PRs.** Anything complex, novel, or
   cross repo goes through the **design gate** (design doc + ADR, owner approved) and is then
   executed as a sequence of independently shippable vertical slices, each behind a feature flag, so
   `main` stays releasable the whole time.
5. **Fail closed. The owner merges.** The server is authoritative, least privilege is the default,
   secrets never touch git or logs, and no agent ever merges its own work. CI green is *necessary*,
   not *sufficient*. The [Definition of Done](DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md) is the real bar.

---

## How an agent enters a repo (works for any tool)

Every repo carries the same entry contract. Whatever tool opens the repo, the reading order is:

1. **The tool's pointer file.** `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
   Each is thin and routes to `AGENTS.md`.
2. **`AGENTS.md`.** The canonical guide. This repo's **Vision & purpose**, tech stack, module map,
   **Critical rules**, **Required reading**, and commands. *Read it first.*
3. **`AGENTS.md` → Required reading.** The README and the `docs/` that explain architecture and
   conventions. Read these before writing code.
4. **[`WORKFLOW.md`](../../WORKFLOW.md).** Know your role, [`AGENT_ROLES.md`](AGENT_ROLES.md), then pick a lane and
   follow the loop.
5. **[`skills.md`](../../skills.md).** Before any security relevant work, follow the matching
   scenario. This is non-optional for auth/OIDC/tokens, BFF/proxy/CSP/cookies, backend authz,
   secrets/config, Terraform/infra, CI/CD, or dependency changes.

If you don't understand the product's purpose or how your task serves it, **stop and ask** before
writing code.

## The three lanes (choose by scale)

| Lane | Use when | Shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Quick** | ≤ ~1 file, no API contract / schema / security change. A typo, copy, comment, log line, or a bug fix with one obviously correct outcome (if the intended behavior is itself a judgment call, size up to Standard) | implement → `make ci` → PR |
| **Standard** | A feature or fix contained in **one** repo | plan (sized to the change) → approve → implement → `make ci` → PR → CI green → handback |
| **Epic** | Complex/novel design, **or** anything spanning **more than one repo** | the Epic track. Discovery → design + ADR → decompose → contract first → hub tracker → slices → integrate |

The full step by step lives in [`WORKFLOW.md`](../../WORKFLOW.md), the design gate and Epic playbook
in [`DESIGN_AND_EPICS.md`](DESIGN_AND_EPICS.md). **When unsure, size up.**

---

## The lifecycle by scale, worked examples

### A. Small. A one line fix (Quick lane)

> *"The dashboard logs `userId` in camelCase. Our convention is `user_id`. Fix it."*

One file, no behavior/contract/schema/security surface, one obviously correct outcome → **Quick**.
The agent edits the line, runs `make ci` to green, bumps the version, opens a branch + PR saying
*what* and *why*, confirms GitHub CI is green, and hands back. No formal plan. The moment it stops
being a one file no behavior change, it switches to Standard.

### B. Medium. A one repo feature (Standard lane)

> *"Add a 'last active' timestamp to the user settings page in the fitness app frontend."*

Contained in `fitness-app-frontend`, no new cross repo contract → **Standard**. The agent **orients**
(reads `AGENTS.md` vision + the relevant `docs/`), writes a **plan sized to the change** and shares
it (a small in pattern change needs only a 2–3 line plan. Anything behavior/contract/schema/auth
waits for explicit approval), **implements** exactly the approved plan, gets **`make ci` green**,
bumps the version, opens a PR against the [Definition of Done](DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md), waits for
**GitHub CI green**, and hands the PR to the owner to merge.

### C. Extreme. A system across several repos (Epic lane)

> *"Build a gamification system that touches everything in the fitness app (points, streaks,
> badges, a leaderboard) across the backend, the shared SDK if needed, the frontend, and infra."*

This spans repos → **Epic**. It runs as **one planned arc, executed as many small PRs**, never a
mega PR:

1. **Discovery. Map the blast radius *and read every touched repo's vision.*** The agent enumerates
   the repos (`fitness-app-backend`, `fitness-app-frontend`, maybe `kriegerdataforge-terraform`,
   and, *only if the auth contract changes*, `kriegerdataforge-sdk`), the contracts, the tables,
   the env vars, and the user surfaces. **Crucially**, it opens each repo's `AGENTS.md` and reads its
   **Vision & purpose** and **Critical rules first**. That's what catches, for example, that a
   gamification `points` table in the fitness DB must use a **plain `user_id` column from the verified
   JWT. Never a cross DB foreign key to `kdfusers`** (the identity decoupling rule), and that the
   frontend's generated API client is **read only**. It also catches that the **leaderboard** must
   render *other* users' names/avatars, data the tenant DB can't own, so it needs the **hub's
   read only public profile lookup** (contract map, row 4), an auth adjacent contract that leads the
   sequence and carries a design note. It also scans `kriegerdataforge/docs/epics/` for an overlapping
   epic and the touched repos' decision logs for ADRs to respect.
2. **Design + ADR. Approved before any code.** The agent writes a design doc
   ([`templates/design-spec.template.md`](templates/design-spec.template.md)), including the
   **per repo vision table** (each repo, its vision, its rules, how the design honors them), and
   records the decision as an ADR (`D-NNN`) in the repo's `docs/CHANGELOG_AND_DECISION_LOG.md`. **The
   owner approves the design before a line of code is written.**
3. **Decompose into flag gated vertical slices.** Each slice is a thin end to end path, independently
   shippable and reviewable, shipped **dark behind a feature flag** (off by default) so `main` stays
   releasable throughout.
4. **Sequence contract-first.** The contract is defined in the repo that **owns** it, then its
   consumers regenerate. For gamification that's `fitness-app-backend` (schema + endpoint) →
   regenerate the typed client (`make openapi` → frontend `make generate-client`) →
   `fitness-app-frontend` builds on it → infra wires the flag. The agent creates **one epic tracker**
   in the hub (`kriegerdataforge/docs/epics/gamification.md`,
   [`templates/epic-tracker.template.md`](templates/epic-tracker.template.md)) as the single source
   of truth. Every slice PR in every repo links back to it.
5. **Execute slices.** Each runs through the Standard lane as its own PR in its own repo, with the
   tracker's status grid updated as each lands.
6. **Integrate & verify.** Enable the flag, run an end to end check across the repos, do an
   adversarial review, record the outcome in the decision log, and close the epic.

### D. Reference epic. The authentication / OIDC system

The ecosystem's auth system is the canonical example of this pattern done for real. The **hub**
(`kriegerdataforge`) is the OIDC/identity provider. The **SDK** (`kriegerdataforge-sdk`) carries the
stateless RS256 JWT verification contract every tenant backend depends on. Each app's **BFF/proxy**
brokers the OIDC flow, and changes ripple **contract first** (hub issues → SDK verifies → apps
consume) behind backward compatible transitions. Auth/OIDC/token work *always* carries a protocol
design note and follows the matching [`skills.md`](../../skills.md) scenario, because a regression in
the hub or SDK breaks **every** downstream product at once. When in doubt on anything auth shaped,
treat it as an Epic with a design gate.

## Who owns which contract (the map)

Getting this right is what keeps cross repo work coherent. **Define each contract in the repo that
owns it, then regenerate/extend its consumers:**

| Contract | Owned by | Consumed how |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Identity / auth.** The JWT, `KDFUser`, claims, scopes, per client audience | `kriegerdataforge-sdk` (verification) + the **hub** (issuance) | every tenant backend verifies via the SDK. Touch the SDK slice **only** when this contract changes |
| **A per app API.** Endpoints + request/response schemas | that **app's own backend** | its frontend consumes a **read only OpenAPI generated client** (`make openapi` → `make generate-client`). The SDK is **not** in this path |
| **The user/identity store** | the **hub** (`kdfusers`) | tenant app DBs reference identity by a **plain `user_id` column from the verified JWT. No cross DB FK**, no per app user table |
| **Other users' public profile.** Display name / avatar for leaderboards, social, mentions | the **hub** (`kriegerdataforge`) | tenant backends resolve arbitrary `user_id`s via a **hub owned read only batch endpoint** (e.g. `GET /users/public?ids=…`) returning display fields only. **Never** a per app user table or cross DB FK. It's a hub contract change, so it leads the contract first sequence and carries a design note |

The single most common cross repo mistake is treating the SDK as the carrier for a *per app* API
contract. It isn't. The SDK is auth-only.

## The artifacts (what each file is)

| File | What it is | When you touch it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | Per repo canonical guide. Vision, stack, rules, required reading | Read first, every task. It's per repo and never synced |
| [`WORKFLOW.md`](../../WORKFLOW.md) | The shared three lane loop | Every task |
| [`DESIGN_AND_EPICS.md`](DESIGN_AND_EPICS.md) | Design gate + cross repo Epic playbook + clarification heuristic | Anything complex/novel/cross repo |
| [`DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`](DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md) | The real bar, scaled by change type | Before opening any PR |
| [`skills.md`](../../skills.md) | Scenario indexed security playbook | Before any security relevant work |
| [`DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md`](DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md) | How repo docs are organized, kept honest, and kept discoverable | Any documentation work |
| [`AGENT_ROLES.md`](AGENT_ROLES.md) | Agent roles and limits for every model and tool, implementer, orchestrator, reviewer and chat reader, and the rules every role keeps | Before you act. `WORKFLOW.md` opens with it |
| [`CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md`](CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md) | The KDF Code Review Process. Any scope, from one function to every repo, reviewed by more than one model at a pinned commit, with the scales, roles, cycle, rules, artifacts and security model | An independent review by more than one model, of any size |
| [`templates/`](templates/) | Copy paste design spec, ADR, epic tracker, contributor onboarding and review campaign templates | When the design gate, an Epic, a review campaign, or a new repo's onboarding applies |
| `docs/guides/CONTRIBUTOR_ONBOARDING.md` | Per repo human setup path (from the kit template) | Per repo and never synced. Update when commands/env change |
| `docs/prompts/` | Per repo documentation authoring toolkit (tailored. The static portfolios don't carry one) | When authoring docs. Per repo and never synced |
| `kriegerdataforge/docs/epics/<name>.md` | One coordinating tracker per cross repo epic (in the hub) | Any multi-repo Epic |
| `docs/CHANGELOG_AND_DECISION_LOG.md` | Append only ADR (`D-NNN`) home, per repo | Architectural decisions |

## How the standard is maintained (the kit + engine)

This whole standard (`WORKFLOW.md`, `AGENT_ROLES.md`, `DESIGN_AND_EPICS.md`, `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`,
`DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md`, `REPORTS_STANDARD.md`, `CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md`, the templates, `skills.md`, and this doc)
is the **agentic workflow kit**. Its single source of truth is
`kriegerdataforge-cicd/kit/common/`. A registry driven sync engine (`scripts/distribute_kit.py`,
driven by `scripts/kit_registry.json`) propagates the kit to every repo as **owner reviewed PRs**
(never auto merged), a weekly job alarms on drift, and new repos are seeded from the four
`kriegerdataforge-template-*` repos. To change the standard. Edit the canonical copy in
`kit/common/`, bump **both** `kit/KIT_VERSION` and the vendored marker
`kit/common/docs/agent/KIT_VERSION` (the engine refuses to run if they disagree), and run the
**Distribute** workflow. **Never hand edit a
synced kit file in a downstream repo**. Your change will be reported as drift and overwritten.
Change the source instead.

---

## How to prompt an agent well (for the owner & developers)

The standard does a lot, but a good prompt makes it sing:

- **State the goal and the *why*, not just the change.** "Add streaks because retention is the
  Q3 priority" lets the agent design toward the vision, "add a streaks column" doesn't.
- **Name the scale or let it size up.** If you know it spans repos, say so. If you're unsure, the
  agent will size up to an Epic and show you a plan. That's the safe default.
- **Name the repos you know are involved**, but trust the discovery step to find the rest and read
  their visions.
- **Expect a plan before code** on anything non-trivial. Review the plan. That's where you steer the
  ambition and catch a wrong direction cheaply. Approving the plan is the highest leverage thing you
  do.
- **You merge.** Every PR comes back to you green. Nothing self-merges. Review against the
  [Definition of Done](DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md).
- **"No restrictions" means on ambition, not on safety.** Tell the agent to aim high. It will still
  fail closed, keep secrets out of git, and pause on anything architectural, destructive, or
  auth-shaped.

---

## Glossary

- **Blast radius.** Every repo, contract, table, env var, and user surface a change touches, mapped
  in Discovery before designing.
- **Vertical slice.** A thin end to end piece of a feature that is independently shippable and
  reviewable, the unit of work in an Epic.
- **Contract first.** Define the API/data contract in the repo that owns it *before* building any
  consumer of it.
- **Flag gated / ship dark.** Merged behind a feature flag that's off by default, so `main` stays
  releasable until the feature is enabled last.
- **Expand / contract migration.** A backward compatible schema change. Add the new shape (expand),
  migrate, then remove the old shape (contract). `main` works against both at every step.
- **KDF Code Review Process.** How any code is reviewed, one function to every repo. The orchestrator fixes, fresh
  Claude and Codex sessions review from one brief at one pinned commit, Sol reads in rounds, every finding is
  reproduced and every fix pinned, and the owner merges. See `CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md`.
- **Pin.** The commit a review reads, pushed, named in the brief. Every reviewer reads it in the repo folder in its own
  turn, or Codex in the cloud on a review branch that never moves off it, and the folder stays at the pin until every
  reviewer has reported, so a reviewer that runs later reads the same code and never another's report. When rule 15
  lets one family go first, the late reviewer reads a later pin and its brief says what to skip.
- **Role.** What an agent may do on a task, implementer by default, reviewer for a review, orchestrator for the session
  that runs one, chat reader in a chat. The same for every model and tool, see `AGENT_ROLES.md`.
- **Orchestrator.** The one long running session that runs a review campaign, writes the briefs, launches the fresh
  reviewers, adjudicates and opens the pull requests. It never merges or deploys.
- **`KDFUser`.** The verified identity principal the SDK returns from a valid JWT. `user.user_id`
  (int), never `user.id`.
- **Hub.** `kriegerdataforge`, the ecosystem's OIDC/identity platform and the home of `kdfusers`
  and the epic trackers.
- **Tenant app.** A product built on the platform (fitness, tiffanys, …). Its DB references identity
  by a plain `user_id` column, never a cross DB FK.
- **BFF / proxy.** The backend for frontend layer in a Next.js app that brokers the OIDC flow and
  keeps server only secrets server only.
- **The kit.** The byte identical agentic workflow markdown synced across all repos from
  `kriegerdataforge-cicd/kit/common/`.
- **Epic tracker.** The single coordinating doc for a cross repo epic, in `kriegerdataforge/docs/epics/`.
- **ADR (`D-NNN`).** An append only Architecture Decision Record in a repo's
  `docs/CHANGELOG_AND_DECISION_LOG.md`.
